        <p>PhDog prides itself on being the most educated dog walking service on
         the planet. Each and every one of our dog walkers either holds a PhD,
         or is in the process of obtaining their PhD. We've come to realize as
         academics that there are other, equally fantastic ways to make ends
         meet - one of them being spending time with furry four-legged friends!</p>

        <p>We should also mention that we're local to the Denver Metro Area. We
          love animals, especially dogs, and we're interested in help give your
          pooch the TLC they deserve during those long lonely days while you're
          out.</p>
