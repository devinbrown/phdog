        <h3>Dave</h3>
        <p>Dave loves to think really hard and tell stories about the world's
          greatest poets, philosophers and historians. He has a background in loving
          animals, but also in masters in medieval literature from the University of
          Glasgow. His love for the natural world precludes his uncanny ability
          to walk for hours thinking about the grandeur of it all.</p>
